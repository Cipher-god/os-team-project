              &emsp;&emsp;"Optimal page replacement algorithm" is the most desirable page replacement algorithm 
              that we use for replacing pages. This algorithm replaces the page whose demand in the future 
              is least as compared to other pages from frames (secondary memory). The replacement occurs when 
              the page fault appears. The purpose of this algorithm is to minimize the number of page faults. 
              Also, one of the most famous abnormalities in the paging technique is "Belady's Anomaly", which is 
              least seen in this algorithm.

              &emsp;&emsp;As we know, when a process is executed in our system, the operating system divides 
              this process into small parts known as 'pages'. And these pages are loaded into secondary memory known as RAMs. 
              Also, the secondary memory is divided into several frames in which the pages are loaded. The size of the page
               is always equal to the size of the frames. When a system calls a page and it is not available in the frame,
               "page fault" occurs. The optimal page replacement algorithm is used to reduce these page faults. It uses the 
               principle that- "when a page is called by the system and it is not available in the frames, the frame which is 
               not in demand for the longest future time is replaced by the new page".

                For each page in the page reference sequence:
                <br>a. If the page is found in the current frame, it is considered a hit.
                <br>b. If the page is not found in the current frame, it is considered a fault.
                <br>i. If there is space available in the frames, the page is added to the frame.
                <br>ii. If there is no space available in the frames, find the page that will not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.
                <br>iii. Replace the page in the frame with the one that caused the faults.
