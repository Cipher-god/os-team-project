              &emsp;&emsp;Peterson's formula was designed to work with just two processes but has 
              since been generalized to accommodate multiple processes.
              <br />
              It would be possible to avoid race conditions if no two processes were ever at a critical stage 
              simultaneously. To solve the critical section problem of mutual exclusion, we need four conditions 
              to be true.
              <ol>
                <li>During critical sections, two processes cannot run simultaneously.</li>
                <li>It is not assumed that processes are running at the same speed or on multiple CPUs.</li>
                <li>There should be no process blocking another process.</li>
                <li>It is important not to act arbitrarily long before entering a critical section in a process.</li>
              </ol>

          <div class="theory-step">
            <ul>
              <label>STEP 1 :</label>
              <li>
                Initialize the shared variables turn and flag to a known state (e.g., turn = 1, flag[0] = flag[1] = false).
              </li>
              <label>STEP 2 :</label>
              <li>
                Each process sets its flag to true to indicate it wants to enter the critical section.
              </li>
              <label>STEP 3 :</label>
              <li>
                Each process sets turn to the other process's id to give the other process priority if it also wants to enter the critical section.
              </li>
              <label>STEP 4 :</label>
              <li>
                Each process enters a busy-waiting loop while the other process's flag is true and it is not its turn.
              </li>
              <label>STEP 5 :</label>
              <li>
                Once a process has exited the busy-waiting loop, it enters the critical section to execute the protected code.
              </li>
              <label>STEP 6 :</label>
              <li>
                When a process is done executing the critical section, it sets its flag to false to indicate it no longer needs access and gives the turn to the other process.
              </li>
              <label>STEP 7 :</label>
              <li>
                The other process can now enter its critical section, or continue to busy-wait if it still needs to wait.
              </li>
